# Practice commands for Linux shell

# Shell is a program that can be used to run commands
# usually called system commands

# ~/its-1801-f22-cli-01$ is called a prompt

# ~ represents the home directory
# / is a separator for directories and or files
# its-1801-f22-cli-01 is another directory

# ls is for listing files and directories in the current directory

# ls -l is for long list format
# the first letter indicates if it is a directory (d) or a file (-)

# ls -al is for long format and showing hidden files

# hidden files, have names that start with a dot (.)

# cd is for changing directories (notice that the prompt also reflects the change)


# To go up one directory:
# cd ..

# Shells usually have autocomplete using the TAB key

# pwd (present working directory) and shows the full path to the directory you are currently in

# cat command (cat stands for catalog)
# To show the contents of a text file (file that has characters that are printable on the screen)

# more command (catalogs a text file page by page ). To advance use the space key, to quit press q (or press CTRL-C)

# clear command clears the screen
